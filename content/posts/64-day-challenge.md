When Shiva was teaching Nath Yoga to Parvati, Parvati slept coz she already knew it, Matsyendra
Nath learned everything when he was a fish. Matsyendranath is a fish who became an enlightened 
being after learning yoga from Shiva. The name Matsyendranath means "Lord of the Fishes". 
While inside the fish, he overheard Shiva teaching yoga to Parvati. 
He began practicing yoga inside the fish's belly. 
After 12 years, he emerged as an enlightened being. 
Shiva renamed the fish Matsyendranath and instructed him to teach others about yoga. 
Shiva transformed the fish into a man, who became known as Matsyendranath. 
Significance
Matsyendranath is considered a semidivine being. 
He is credited with writing some of the earliest Sanskrit texts on Hatha yoga. 
His name appears on lists of the nine nathas and the 84 mahasiddhas. 
His leading disciple was Gorakhnath, who is considered the founder of the Kanphata Yogis.
