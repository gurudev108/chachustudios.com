I envision myself travelling the world to pass on the message of yoga. Initially, many people thought that yoga was a type of religion, witchcraft or mysticism. The materialistic world did not understand yoga for some time but as scientists dived deep into the mysteries of matter, they came to understand that matter wasn't the ultimate point in the evolution of nature. 

This external experience, the perception of our senses is a product of matter. Even our thoughts, feelings, emotions and cognitions are a product of matter. Therefore, they cannot be absolute and final. This means there must be another realm of experience and if there is, it must be possible to transcend the present limitations of the mind.

The mind is also matter, it is definitely not spirit. Therefore, the mind can be transformed and made to evolve.
